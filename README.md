# Approximate-Nearest-Neighbor-Search-Optimization


---


## 💡 Overview

This project is an implementation of advanced graph-based algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), specifically focusing on Filtered ANNS. Developed in C++, the application efficiently finds the k nearest neighbors of a query vector, given an associated filter/label.


---


## ⚙️ Features

The project addresses several core challenges in high-dimensional ANNS and performance optimization:

- **Filtered ANNS (F-Vamana)**: Implementation of the Filtered Vamana indexing algorithm and the associated Filtered Greedy Search for efficient queries with label filters.
- **Stitched ANNS (S-Vamana)**: Implementation of the Stitched Vamana algorithm, which constructs the graph by merging (stitching) smaller Vamana indices built on labeled subsets of the data.
- **Graph Pruning**: Includes the Filtered Robust Prune procedure to maintain a bounded maximum out-degree (R) for the graph.
- **Performance Optimization**: Incorporates performance enhancements achieved through:
- Parallel Execution using threading (e.g., pthreads or std::thread/OpenMP).
- Optimizations such as calculating distances, initializing graphs with random edges, and modifying medoid selection.
- **Software Testing**: Utilizes appropriate libraries for software testing and verifies correctness automatically via GitHub Actions upon every commit/push.
- **Coding Standards**: Adherence to the code specifications and standards set by the SIGMOD 2024 Programming Contest.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Build and Run

The provided Makefile includes preset targets for easy execution of the various phases of the assignment.

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alexandros-koutras/Approximate-Nearest-Neighbor-Search-Optimization
cd Approximate-Nearest-Neighbor-Search-Optimization

### 2. Compile and run
You can execute the program directly using the predefined Makefile targets:

make run

This command runs the program with the default set of arguments defined in the Makefile.

If you wish to test the program with alternative argument configurations, you can specify a numbered variant (from 1 to 4) as follows:

make run1
make run2
make run3
make run4

Each target corresponds to a different predefined argument set, allowing quick testing under various parameter combinations.
